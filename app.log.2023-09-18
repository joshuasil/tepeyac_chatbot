Chances are good that they ate mostly grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables. They didn't eat a lot of meat and cheese. For snacks, they ate fruit, or maybe nuts and seeds, like roasted pumpkin seeds. It is tempting to eat fast food and processed food in the US because it is often cheap and always around.

You feel anxious because you can't sleep, and then it makes it harder to sleep! It's even worse when you realize that sleep helps to reduce anxiety. But less anxiety + better sleep = better health, so you can try things like meditation, yoga, and journaling about your anxiety--all these will help your sleep improve too!, numbered_intents: Click the link: https://www.tepeyachealth.org/new-patient-registration to schedule an appointment.
